//============================================================================
//  sdram_beat32 — 32-bit machine beats on the 16-bit MiSTer SDRAM controller.
//
//  Wraps rtl/sdram.sv (Sorgelig's, from NeoGeo_MiSTer) and the clk_sys <->
//  clk_ram handshake that used to live inline in wombat33.sv.  Three things
//  here that the plain two-access bridge did not do:
//
//  * A READ FILLS A 16-BYTE LINE.  The controller programs BURST_LENGTH=8,
//    so one READ returns four aligned longwords.  All four are retained in
//    this bridge; later reads from that line complete without another SDRAM
//    command.  This matches the AP68040 cache's four-beat refill pattern and
//    removes three serialized clk_sys/clk_ram handshakes per cache miss.
//    Writes still take two accesses; NO_WRITE_BURST=1 in the mode register.
//
//  * THE RELATED CLOCKS USE TIMED HALF-CYCLE HANDOFFS.  clk_sys and clk_ram
//    are phase-aligned 1:3 outputs of the same PLL.  Capturing the request and
//    completion toggles on clk_ram's falling edge removes the two conservative
//    2FF synchronisers while leaving a timed half-cycle on every crossing.
//    Hardware-tested read latency: 7 -> 5 clk_sys (~212 -> ~151 ns).
//
//  * WRITES ARE POSTED.  ack fires as the beat is captured and the drain
//    happens behind the machine's back.  Nothing downstream had to change
//    for that: the whole stall chain — this bridge, wombat_bus32, the
//    cache's write-through C_PASS state, the core — is ack-based, so
//    releasing the ack releases all of it.  Ordering is free, because the
//    next beat still waits on `busy`: a read that follows a posted write
//    cannot start until the write has been issued to the chip.  Posting
//    hides write latency; it does not add bandwidth, so a sustained store
//    stream still drains at the controller's rate.
//
//  Beat contract (clk_sys):
//   - req is level-held; a beat is captured on the first cycle with
//     !busy && !ack, and req may drop as soon as ack is seen.
//   - ack is a single-cycle pulse.  For a read it means "rdata is valid";
//     for a write it means "accepted", not "in the chip".
//   - busy spans the whole access, a posted write's drain included, and is
//     the only thing that orders one beat against the next.
//
//  Byte lanes: be[3] is the byte at addr+0 = wdata[31:24] (the machine's
//  big-endian convention), so the first SDRAM word carries wdata[31:16].
//  Nothing else reads this memory, so the in-chip order only has to agree
//  with itself.
