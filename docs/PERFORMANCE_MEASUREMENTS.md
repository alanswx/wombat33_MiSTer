# Performance measurements — Speedometer 4.02

> **2026-09-01 follow-up:** a timing-clean related-clock SDRAM handoff now
> measures 151 ns per isolated read and 22.0 MB/s sequentially in
> `tb_sdram`. On hardware, Speedometer **3.23 PR Tests** improved from CPU
> 2.661 on the seed-13 control to **2.917** on seed 15 (+9.6%). Version 3.23's
> PR score is not the same metric as the 4.02 Benchmark Mix below; see §8.
> A 2026-09-02 BL8/open-page follow-up raises that same 3.23 CPU score to
> **3.139** and passes the full suite; see §9.

Three-way comparison of a **real Quadra 800**, the **Wombat33 core before the
SDRAM fast path**, and the **core with it**. Measured 2026-09-01 on hardware
(DE10-Nano + MiSTer SDRAM board), same disk image, same ROM, same Mac OS.

| | Benchmark Mix | Color QuickDraw |
|---|---|---|
| Real Quadra 800 | **1.897** | **1.283** |
| Wombat33 `20260831_2` (before) | 0.200 | 0.198 |
| Wombat33 seed 13 (after) | **0.231** | **0.219** |
| **Gain from the SDRAM work** | **+15.5 %** | **+10.6 %** |
| **Still short of real hardware by** | **8.2×** | **5.9×** |

Speedometer's ratios are against a **Quadra 605 = 1.0** (FPU against a Quadra
650). Higher is better. For the `(sec)` rows a *lower* absolute is better; for
the `/sec` rows a *higher* absolute is better.

The headline: the memory work is worth a solid, reproducible **15 %** of real
CPU throughput — and the emulated Quadra is still **roughly eight times slower
than the machine it is emulating**.

## 1. What was compared

| | Real Quadra 800 | Before | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bitstream | — | `releases/wombat33_20260831_2.rbf` | seed 13 of `cpu-speed-sdram` |
| md5 | — | `4414e7b3294b3d554a9e43faa16682bd` | `abb5ede4f776d20ccd74367813aa1d28` |
| Provenance | photograph | commit `cc53fbd` | branch `cpu-speed-sdram`, `3d1f28c` |
| Timing (STA) | — | met, +0.062 ns | **met, +0.132 ns** |
| CPU | MC68040 | MC68040 | MC68040 |
| FPU / MMU | Integral / Integral | Integral / Integral | Integral / Integral |
| ROM | `$067C`, 1024K | `$067C`, 1024K | `$067C`, 1024K |
| Physical RAM | 122880K | 32768K | 32768K |
| Bus clock | 33.33 MHz | 33.000 MHz | 33.000 MHz |

Both Wombat33 md5s were verified **on the MiSTer after the push**, not just
locally. The guest was shut down from the Apple menu before every core swap.

Seed 13 is the fit that **meets timing** — `scripts/deploy_screenshot.sh`
passed it with "Timing OK — worst slack +0.132 ns" and no override, the only
build in this campaign that did. Seed 8 (−0.501 ns) was measured first and
produced numbers identical to seed 13 within noise, which is the expected
result: a fitter seed changes placement, not throughput. See
`wombat33.qsf` for the full seed walk.

Two differences from the real machine worth keeping in mind: it has 128 MB
against our 32 MB (irrelevant to these tests, which are cache- and
bandwidth-bound rather than capacity-bound), and its bus is 1 % faster.

## 2. Benchmark Mix

Absolute values. One iteration of every test, which is what the reference
photograph used.

| Test | Real Q800 | Before | After | After vs before | After vs real |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| KWhetstones/sec | 1978.474 | 157.809 | 190.895 | **+21.0 %** | 10.4× slower |
| Dhrystones/sec | 24999.350 | 2033.948 | 2378.625 | **+17.0 %** | 10.5× slower |
| Towers (sec) | 0.469 | 5.048 | 4.250 | **−15.8 %** | 9.1× |
| Quick Sort (sec) | 0.532 | 3.396 | 3.016 | −11.2 % | 5.7× |
| Bubble Sort (sec) | 0.566 | 3.885 | 3.569 | −8.1 % | 6.3× |
| Queens (sec) | 0.307 | 3.047 | 2.622 | −14.0 % | 8.5× |
| Puzzle (sec) | 0.799 | 5.739 | 5.366 | −6.5 % | 6.7× |
| Permutations (sec) | 0.619 | 8.575 | 7.051 | **−17.8 %** | 11.4× |
| Int. Matrix (sec) | 0.599 | 4.766 | 4.335 | −9.0 % | 7.2× |
| Sieve (sec) | 0.974 | 5.821 | 5.187 | −10.9 % | 5.3× |
| **Average ratio** | **1.897** | **0.200** | **0.231** | **+15.5 %** | **8.2×** |

The spread across tests is itself informative. Permutations (+17.8 %) and
Towers (+15.8 %) gain most — both are pointer-chasing, cache-missing workloads
that spend their time waiting on memory. Puzzle (+6.5 %) and Bubble Sort
(+8.1 %) gain least, being tight loops that mostly stay in the '040's caches
and were never waiting on SDRAM. That is exactly the signature the change
should produce, and it is a useful sanity check that the gain is real rather
than measurement drift.

## 3. Color QuickDraw

All four depths from 1-bit to 8-bit; 16 bits/pixel is greyed out in Speedometer
on this hardware and was not run on the real machine either.

| Test | Real Q800 | Before | After | After vs before | After vs real |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monochrome (sec) | 5.356 | 36.804 | 32.936 | −10.5 % | 6.1× |
| Two Bit (sec) | 5.961 | 40.341 | 36.285 | −10.1 % | 6.1× |
| Four Bit (sec) | 6.806 | 43.115 | 39.054 | −9.4 % | 5.7× |
| Eight bit (sec) | 8.242 | 49.479 | 45.212 | −8.6 % | 5.5× |
| **Average ratio** | **1.283** | **0.198** | **0.219** | **+10.6 %** | **5.9×** |

Colour gains less than the CPU mix (~10 % against ~15 %), which fits: QuickDraw
here is drawing into **VRAM, which is on-chip BRAM**, not SDRAM. Only the
source data and the drawing code itself come through the memory path this
branch touched, so only part of the work could speed up.

## 4. FPU

Not run on the previous release (agreed to skip). Seed 8 only, for the record,
against a Quadra 650 = 1.0:

| Test | Abs. | Rat. |
|---|---|---|
| KWhetstones/sec | 827.979 | 0.159 |
| Matrix Mult. (sec) | 4.572 | 0.154 |
| Fast Fourier (sec) | 1.679 | 0.171 |
| **Average** | | **0.161** |

## 5. How much to trust these numbers

**Benchmark Mix reproduces to under 1 %, across two different bitstreams.**
Four independent runs — three on seed 8 (the last after a flash to the
previous release and back) and one on seed 13:

| Test | s8 run 1 | s8 run 2 | s8 run 3 | seed 13 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| KWhetstones/sec | 190.959 | 191.395 | 191.015 | 190.895 |
| Dhrystones/sec | 2378.068 | 2379.446 | 2378.287 | 2378.625 |
| Towers | 4.250 | 4.249 | 4.250 | 4.250 |
| Permutations | 7.050 | 7.048 | 7.051 | 7.051 |
| Sieve | 5.186 | 5.169 | 5.187 | 5.187 |
| **Average** | **0.231** | **0.231** | **0.231** | **0.231** |

The previous release was likewise run twice (average 0.200 both times, every
test within 2 %). A 0.200 → 0.231 difference is an order of magnitude larger
than that noise. That seed 8 and seed 13 agree to three decimals is also the
expected control: a fitter seed changes placement and timing closure, not what
the machine computes per second.

**The 8-bit colour test has one bad sample, now identified.** Four
measurements of it on this RTL: 43.713, **32.440**, 45.184 and 45.212 seconds.
Three cluster tightly around 45 s; the 32.440 s reading is a lone outlier. An
earlier sweep that caught it suggested a 22 % colour gain — that number is
wrong, and it is recorded here only so nobody rediscovers it and believes it.
The table in §3 uses the reproducible value. Monochrome, 2-bit and 4-bit
repeat to within 0.5 % across every run. **What produced the single fast
sample is still unexplained and worth a look.**

**A screensaver is armed on this disk** and its idle timeout sits somewhere
between 250 s and 400 s. One early run ended with it up; that run was repeated
inside a shorter window and agreed to three decimals, so it did no harm, but
any future timing work on this machine should keep runs inside ~250 s of the
last input or disable it first.

## 6. Method

Speedometer 4.02, from `Quad Squad:Utilities:`. Driven over the MiSTer remote
websocket (`scripts/mister_ws.py`); helper scripts in `scratch/perf/`.

- The guest's **Command key is PS/2 Left Alt** (`rtl/adb.sv:530` maps it to ADB
  `$37`), i.e. Linux keycode 56, so ⌘B is `down:56 raw:48 up:56`. Speedometer's
  shortcuts — ⌘B Benchmark Mix, ⌘G Color QuickDraw, ⌘F FPU — make the whole
  run keyboard-driven; only the checkboxes need the mouse.
- Navigation to the app used the Finder's **type-select + ⌘O**, which is far
  more reliable than clicking icons.
- **No screenshots were taken during a run.** The capture is an HTTP POST the
  core services, and it perturbs what is being timed.
- Mouse positioning is a closed loop, because mrext sends *relative* motion and
  Mac OS accelerates it — the event-to-pixel scale measured anywhere from 1.3
  to well over 8 px per event depending on how many events got coalesced into
  one ADB report. `scratch/perf/click.sh` pins the pointer into the top-left
  corner (the one position the screen edge makes certain) and then walks to the
  target, re-measuring the scale from a screenshot after every move.
- A dialog screenshotted immediately after it opens can be caught mid-redraw,
  missing its title, static text and button labels. That is not a rendering
  fault; give it a few seconds before grabbing. (It briefly looked like a
  regression from this branch until the same dialog was re-grabbed with a
  settle delay and drew perfectly.)

The seed-8 capture (`perf/wombat33_seed8_sdram-fastpath.png`) is kept as the
independent second sample.

## 7. What this says about the SDRAM work

`docs/sdram-fast-path.md` measured the memory path in isolation with
`verilator/tb_sdram.sv`: an isolated store fell from 242 ns to 30 ns and a read
beat from 272 ns to 212 ns. This document is the end-to-end consequence of
that: **+15.5 % on the CPU mix, +10.6 % on colour**, on real silicon running
real Mac OS, in a build that meets timing.

That ratio is worth understanding rather than being disappointed by. An 8×
store latency win does not become an 8× machine win because most instructions
are not stores and most stores were already overlapping with something. The
tests that gained most are the ones that miss cache most, which is the
signature of a genuine memory-path improvement.

**The gap that remains is the interesting part.** At 8.2× slower than a real
Quadra 800 on the CPU mix, the bottleneck is no longer only the platform's
memory path:

- A read beat is now 212 ns of which the SDRAM row cycle is ~81 ns; the rest is
  the two clock-domain crossings. Removing them (§1c of the speed plan) is the
  next platform item and is worth more than its position in the running order
  suggested.
- Page mode (§1d) is the structural prerequisite for real-Quadra bandwidth;
  the follow-up prototype shows it must be paired with a full-line path.
- Beyond that the remaining terms are inside the CPU core — the write-through
  cache with no write buffer, and the lack of an early ack on line fills — which
  live in the `rtl/ap68040` submodule.

A useful next measurement would be the same three-way comparison after the
page-mode work (§1d) lands, to see how much of the 8.2× is memory and how much
is the core.

## 8. Related-clock handoff follow-up (Speedometer 3.23)

The current disposable MacAtrium test disk contains Speedometer 3.23, not the
4.02 copy used above. That prevents a direct update of the real-Q800 comparison,
but it still gives a controlled before/after measurement on one disk and one
benchmark version.

| Speedometer 3.23 PR Test | seed-13 control | seed-15 handoff | gain |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CPU | 2.661 | **2.917** | **+9.6%** |
| Graphics | 3.487 | **3.903** | **+11.9%** |
| Disk | 0.671 | **0.679** | +1.2% |
| Math | 15.841 | **18.446** | **+16.4%** |
| Old PR | 3.829 | **4.318** | **+12.8%** |
| New PR | 1.850 | **1.946** | **+5.2%** |

The seed-15 RBF is `releases/wombat33_20260901_2.rbf`, MD5
`d1d785de28439d132333a1c9e3aab5c5`. Quartus reports +0.270 ns overall
setup and +0.241 ns overall hold; the 99 MHz domain is +1.353 ns setup and
+0.431 ns hold. The guest booted Mac OS, completed the PR suite, and was shut
down normally before the disk or core was touched again.

Seed-13 control:

![Speedometer 3.23 PR control](perf/wombat33_seed13_speedometer323_pr.png)

Seed-15 related-clock handoff:

![Speedometer 3.23 PR handoff](perf/wombat33_seed15_cdc_speedometer323_pr.png)

The 4.02 application came from `Quad Squad:Utilities:` on the original 2 GB
Quad Squad image. The currently mounted `QuadSquad8.hda` is a 90 MB disposable
clone of the MacAtrium disk, so recovering that original image from the NAS or
archive is the prerequisite for rerunning the published 4.02 tables.

## 9. BL8/open-page follow-up (Speedometer 3.23)

The next memory-only step keeps the machine's established registered bus
completion but changes the SDRAM side to an open-page controller and captures
the complete BL8 read as a retained 16-byte line. The requested longword is
returned critical-word-first while the burst tail finishes in the background.
The controller tracks open rows independently for all eight `{rank,bank}`
combinations and refreshes both ranks.

A fresh run of the seed-15 handoff RBF immediately before the experiment is
the control below. Both runs used the same pristine `QuadSquad8.hda` image,
Speedometer 3.23, Mac OS 7.5.5, and one iteration of every PR category.

| Speedometer 3.23 PR Test | seed-15 control | BL8/open-page | gain |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CPU | 2.917 | **3.139** | **+7.6%** |
| Graphics | 3.817 | **4.159** | **+9.0%** |
| Disk | 0.672 | **0.684** | +1.8% |
| Math | 18.224 | **20.843** | **+14.4%** |
| Old PR | 4.269 | **4.724** | **+10.7%** |
| New PR | 1.928 | **2.013** | **+4.4%** |

The hardware RBF is `Wombat33_BL8_stockmachine_seed17_20260902.rbf`, MD5
`e20f8dfff1d27b4df2195708bcdecc39`. Quartus reports +0.185 ns overall setup
and +0.244 ns overall hold. The full PR suite completed normally, including
Disk. The directed SDRAM model reports 43.7 MB/s for sequential bridge reads,
181 ns for a cold critical word, 121 ns for an open-page read, and 30 ns for a
retained-line read. The whole stock machine transport remains slower at an
estimated 19.5 MB/s / 819 ns per 16-byte fill because each longword still
crosses the registered transaction adapter and service FSM.

Two more aggressive handshakes were rejected on hardware. Both completed CPU
and Graphics but froze during Disk; one included the full pre-adapter line
bypass, while the other disabled that bypass and retained only direct memory
acknowledgement. The passing stock-machine build therefore clears BL8 and the
open-page controller and isolates the remaining fault to the shortened
completion path. Future work should shorten RAM completion only, leaving the
ROM, VRAM, IOSB, DAFB, and open-bus cadence unchanged, and must pass the full
Disk test before it replaces this baseline.

### Registered retained-line service

The first safe follow-up exposes the retained BL8 line to `quadra800`, but
serves its words through the existing registered service-FSM acknowledgement.
It removes three redundant bridge transactions per fill without changing the
transaction adapter's completion cadence. The integrated model improves from
19.5 to **25.1 MB/s**, and a 16-byte fill falls from 819 to **636 ns**.

| Speedometer 3.23 PR Test | BL8/open-page | registered line | gain |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CPU | 3.139 | **3.258** | **+3.8%** |
| Graphics | 4.159 | **4.373** | **+5.1%** |
| Disk | 0.684 | 0.679 | -0.7% |
| Math | 20.843 | **21.694** | **+4.1%** |
| Old PR | 4.724 | **4.920** | **+4.1%** |
| New PR | 2.013 | **2.039** | **+1.3%** |

The RBF is `Wombat33_BL8_regline_seed17_20260902.rbf`, MD5
`628021ac778ef96c45d84d9232e4644a`. Quartus reports +0.289 ns setup and
+0.252 ns hold. It booted Mac OS and completed the full PR suite, including
Disk. Against the fresh seed-15 control at the start of this section, the
cumulative CPU gain is **+11.7%** (2.917 to 3.258).

### Registered pre-adapter line hits

The next step bypasses `wombat_bus32` only for aligned longword reads that are
already present in the retained BL8 line. The completion remains a registered
one-cycle pulse. The adapter's active state and previous acknowledgement both
gate the bypass, preventing the just-completed critical word from being
acknowledged twice. A first miss, byte/word or misaligned access, page-table
walk, write, and every non-RAM device continue to use the established adapter
and service-FSM path. A request for the still-arriving tail of the same line
waits instead of launching a duplicate SDRAM transaction.

The integrated post-cache model improves from 25.1 to **43.7 MB/s** and a
16-byte fill falls from 636 to **365 ns**. It passes 64 sequential reads and
2,048 mixed posted-write/read operations in order, while the independent SDRAM
test remains 45/45 with zero chip-protocol errors and the bus adapter remains
6/6. The complete Verilator machine also builds successfully.

| Speedometer 3.23 PR Test | registered line | registered bus line | gain |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CPU | 3.258 | **3.378** | **+3.7%** |
| Graphics | 4.373 | **4.536** | **+3.7%** |

| Old PR | 4.920 | **5.112** | **+3.9%** |
| New PR | 2.039 | **2.072** | **+1.6%** |

The RBF is `Wombat33_BL8_regbusline_seed17_20260902.rbf`, MD5
`df9e97bfc14612b1221cd10112e9dad3`. Quartus reports +0.139 ns setup and
+0.183 ns hold, with zero setup or hold TNS. It booted Mac OS 7.5.5 and
completed one iteration of every PR category, including Disk, before a clean
guest shutdown. The disposable test disk was then restored byte-for-byte from
the pristine image; both copies had MD5 `9c685af4dd7016cf1e664a908e2d9cbe`.

Against the fresh seed-15 control, the cumulative gains are **+15.8% CPU**,
**+18.8% Graphics**, and **+24.2% Math**. The bridge itself has now reached
43.7 MB/s, so the remaining gap to the real Quadra 800's 50--65 MB/s is no
longer dominated by repeated SDRAM reads within a cache fill. The conservative
next memory-only target is first-miss latency: shorten only the RAM critical
word path while retaining a registered CPU-visible acknowledgement and the
adapter's ownership/order checks. Broad direct memory acknowledgement remains
rejected because it froze the hardware Disk test even when line bypass was
disabled.

### Registered direct first miss

Aligned longword reads to decoded RAM now bypass `wombat_bus32` on the first
miss as well as on retained-line hits. The SDRAM completion still enters a
dedicated register before it reaches the CPU, so this does not restore the
combinational direct-ack path that failed the Disk test. Writes, byte/word and
misaligned accesses, page-table walks, and every non-RAM target retain the
established adapter and service-FSM path.

The integrated post-cache model improves from 43.7 to **52.4 MB/s**, inside the
real Quadra 800's 50--65 MB/s sequential-RAM range. A 16-byte fill falls from
365 to **304 ns**. It passes 64 sequential reads and 2,048 mixed
posted-write/read operations in order; the independent SDRAM test remains
45/45 with zero chip-protocol errors, the transaction adapter remains 6/6,
and the complete Verilator machine builds.

`677c60e85fcd766c59faa026564b511e5433051cb6690078467b11ed68fd30d8`.
Quartus reports +0.143 ns setup and +0.250 ns hold with zero setup or hold
TNS. It booted Mac OS 7.5.5, completed one iteration of every PR category,
including Disk, and shut down cleanly. Against the fresh seed-15 control, the
cumulative gains are **+17.4% CPU**, **+19.0% Graphics**, and **+26.0% Math**.

The MiSTer auto-mount file points at
`games/Wombat33/QuadSquad8.hda`; that is the disposable image. Cleanup after
this run exposed that the previous 9c685... restore command had treated that
mounted file as the source and copied it over the unmounted MacAtrium copy, so
the exact 9c685... snapshot is no longer present. A new cleanly shut-down
golden was established at
`games/MacIIvi/MacAtrium-7.5.5-fullcolor_speedtest.hda`, MD5
`0c4f774b4a2eccd5656e92f16119875f`, with a restore-verified compressed copy at
`games/Wombat33/backup/MacAtrium-7.5.5-fullcolor_speedtest_golden_20260902.hda.gz`.
Future runs must copy or decompress that golden **to** `QuadSquad8.hda`; the
golden must never be used as the restore destination or mounted by the core.
