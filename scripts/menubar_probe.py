"""Report which Mac OS menu-bar title is currently pulled down.

The open title is drawn as a filled dark box in the menu bar while every other
title is dark text on a light bar, so the highlighted one is the widest run of
columns that are dark through the WHOLE bar height.

  python3 scripts/menubar_probe.py <shot.png>
  -> "OPEN x=[154,208] center=181"   or   "NONE"

Exists because the event-to-pixel scale of mrext motion is not stable -- it
depends on how many moves get coalesced into one ADB report -- so a script that
walks a fixed number of steps to a menu will sometimes land one menu over.
Callers should step and re-probe rather than trust a step count.
