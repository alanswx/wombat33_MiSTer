#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/mac_shutdown.sh — shut Mac OS down from INSIDE the guest (Special ->
# Shut Down) before swapping cores.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Reloading the core while Mac OS is running is a hard
# power-cut on a mounted HFS volume. Doing it repeatedly on 2026-08-30 corrupted
# the Quad Squad image badly enough that it hung mid-boot at a repeatable offset
# — which then got misdiagnosed as an RTL fault more than once. Always shut the
# guest down first; only load a new core once the screen says it is safe.
#
# HOW IT DRIVES THE MOUSE. mrext sends RELATIVE motion and Mac OS applies mouse
# acceleration, so one big delta does NOT move a predictable number of pixels.
# Everything here therefore moves in 1-pixel steps, which stays under the
# acceleration threshold and tracks 1:1. The cursor is first "pinned" to the
# top-left by driving it hard into the corner, giving a known origin — the ADB
# mouse only reports deltas, so there is no absolute position to read back.
#
# STATUS 2026-08-30 (evening): WORKING. The click failed until the via6522
# shift-clock fix (docs/adb-via-shift.md) -- the mouse button is bit 7 of ADB
# Talk R0 byte 0 and every delivered byte reached the driver shifted one place
# left, so the button bit was thrown away. mrext's payloads were always right;
# it was the core. (Note the payloads ARE `left_down`/`left_up`; `mouseBtn:1`
# and `:0` are logged by mrext and do nothing.)
#
# The step counts below were RE-MEASURED after that fix and are motion EVENTS,
# not pixels: ~1.5 px each. They were 1:1 before, because the same bug also
# doubled the deltas -- so do not restore the old numbers, and re-measure with
# a screenshot rather than trusting either set blindly.
#
# Pacing matters: 0.008 s between motion events outruns the ~90 Hz ADB poll and
# the moves are silently lost. 0.02 s is what these counts were measured at.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/mac_shutdown.sh            # do it, with verification shots
#   bash scripts/mac_shutdown.sh --dry-run  # print the plan only
#
# Verify before you trust it: shots land in scratch/shutdown_*.png.
